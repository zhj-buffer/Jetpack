>You can see the file which need to be installed are all under this folder. In case you are using sdkmanger. The rootfs are locate under "~/nvidia/nvidia_sdk/JetPack_4.2_Linux_P2888/Linux_for_Tegra$"

- Try to chroot to jetson roofs to cross install all the package you need. Now you are under "~/nvidia/nvidia_sdk/JetPack_4.2_Linux_P2888/Linux_for_Tegra"

>On X86 Host:

		sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf rootfs/etc/
		sudo cp qemu-aarch64-static rootfs/usr/bin/
		sudo cp -rf ~/Downloads/nvidia/sdkm_downloads/ rootfs/
		sudo cp install.sh rootfs/sdkm_downloads
		sudo bash ch-mount.sh -m rootfs
	
>Now you are under rootfs. Let's install all the package.

		cd sdkm_downloads && bash install.sh
		apt update && apt install -f
		exit

>Exit the rootfs. Now you are returned to X86 Host.

		sudo bash ch-mount.sh -u rootfs
		sudo rm rootfs/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static
		sudo rm rootfs/sdkm_downloads -rf

- Now let's begin to flash the jetson board. First put the Xavier into recover mode. 

>Note: The usb-type-c used for flashing the board should be close to the led. 
>Do not use the one close to the dc input. Check with command:

		lsusb
>You'll get:

		Bus 002 Device 015: ID 0955:7020 NVidia Corp. 
>Continue:

		sudo ./apply_binaries.sh
		sudo ./flash.sh jetson-xavier mmcblk0p1

>For TX2: 

		sudo ./flash.sh jetson-tx2 mmcblk0p1
		

After about 30min there will be a pop-up window to notice you to setup. After that everything is ready. Next flash cycle, just run the last. command.
